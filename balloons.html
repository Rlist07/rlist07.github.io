        since fall '23 and have participated in two launches so far.

            <h2 class="text-lg text-lightaccent font-bold mb-1">Spring '24 launch</h2>
            <p class="text-base">
                This was the team's <strong>first launch in nearly a decade</strong>. We launched from update New York with a projected payload landing in Eastern
                Connecticut. The payload consisted of a GoPro, temperature and humidity sensors, and altimiter. Sensors were powered by an arduino
                and would save data every few minutes to be reviewed after recovery.
                <br>
                We would track the payload with a GPS module relaying its position to a handheld radio, which would communicate with us through
                APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System). We also used a commercially available GPS tracker as a backup.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-base text-lightaccent font-bold mb-1 mt-4">Problems</h2>
            <p class="text-base">
                Our first issue involved the tracking systems. We lost signal from both immediately after launch, and lost our payload. We would later
                find out that the <strong>two GPS units were interfering with each other</strong>.
                <br>
                I told the team that one GPS unit would outlast the other, at which point it would start communicating again, and we'd be able to recover the payload.
                <br>
                This came to fruition the next day, but another problem arose: <strong>the balloon was underfilled</strong>.
                <br>
                As a balloon ascends, it expands until it bursts. An underfilled balloon ascends slower, so it is carried further by wind before it bursts.
                <br>
                What was supposed to be a <strong>3 hour flight turned out to be an 18 hour flight</strong>. Our commercial GPS tracker started pinging in the morning at
                30,000 feet, which means the payload was descending. Except it was pinging a <strong>few hundred miles off the Eastern coast of the US</strong>. We watched for half
                an hour as the payload fell into the Atlantic and went silent.

            <p class="text-base">
                The goal for this launch was a successful recovery. We <strong>lightened the payload</strong>, <strong>used only one GPS unit</strong>, and 
                <strong>verified the balloon was filled</strong> all the way.
                The frame was a simple triangle made from plywood with an Insta360 camera, portable battery, and GPS at each corner.
                <br>
                Our <strong>launch was successful</strong>, but the balloon landed in a very tall tree in someone's backyard in Connecticut. This someone turned out to be a profesional
                tree trimmer. About a month later he would cut down our payload and ship it to Columbia.
                <br>
                Typically, at high altitudes you have to worry about extreme cold temperatures. It turns out the Insta360 would have the opposite problem: overheating.
                The camera shut off at a few thousand feet, so our footage is limited to the first half hour out of a 2.5 hour flight.

            <p class="text-base">
                This year we are focusing on pico balloons, which are very small balloons with very light payloads.
                <br>
                The balloons should be able to circumnavigate the globe multiple times, and give us their location a few times a day.
                They'll be solar powered with a GPS unit and a couple weather sensors.
