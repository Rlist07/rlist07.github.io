        . It's a personal beer rating app that rates beers relative to other beers you've had.
        <br>
        It uses an insertion sort algorithm to rank beers by asking you to compare two beers at a time. Then numbers are assigned across the 
        list of beers to give them a score out of 10.
        <br>
        Beerbelly also lets you see what your friends are drinking and their ratings.
        <br>
        <br>
        We used natural language processing to analyze different styles of beers, and cluster similar beers together. With these clusters, we can 
        recommend beers and predict how much a user might like a beer they haven't had yet.
        <br>
        Backend is built with Python and FastAPI. Frontend is built with React.

        Below is a one sheeter that we gave to the founders of Beli, whose app inspired ours.
